## Introduction

In machine learning, the quality of training data plays a crucial role in model performance. Synthetic data generation helps in creating large datasets, but validation is key. Our tool integrates human review to ensure the generated data meets quality standards. This is particularly useful for tasks such as question-answer generation, where precision is vital.

## Features

- **Human Validation**: Ensure the quality of synthetic data through human review.
- **Flexible Integration**: Easily integrate with various machine learning frameworks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified process for data annotation and review.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Leverage advanced models for generating questions and answers.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Output data in various formats suitable for different applications.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies, including:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for development.
- **Label Studio**: A tool for data annotation.
- **OpenAI**: For generating synthetic data.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Such as TensorFlow and PyTorch for model training.
- **Natural Language Processing Libraries**: Like NLTK and spaCy for text processing.

## Installation

To get started with the QA Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ndiwawan/qa-generator-with-human-review.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd qa-generator-with-human-review
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up Label Studio for data annotation:
   - Follow the [Label Studio documentation](https://labelstud.io/) for installation and setup.

## Usage

To use the QA Generator, you can follow these steps:

1. Start the Label Studio server:
   ```bash
   label-studio start
   ```

2. Create a new project and configure it to accept question-answer pairs.

3. Use the provided scripts to generate synthetic data:
   ```bash
   python generate_data.py
   ```

4. Once data is generated, it will be sent to Label Studio for human review.

5. After review, download the validated data for training your machine learning models.

## Human Review Process

The human review process is essential for ensuring the quality of synthetic data. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Data Generation**: The tool generates a set of question-answer pairs.
2. **Annotation**: Reviewers evaluate the quality of each pair, marking them as correct or incorrect.
3. **Feedback Loop**: Reviewers can provide feedback to improve the generation process.
4. **Final Validation**: Only data that passes the human review is considered for model training.

This process not only enhances data quality but also allows for continuous improvement in the generation algorithms.
